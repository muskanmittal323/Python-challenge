# Python-challenge

This project contains two Python challenges: PyBank and PyPoll. PyBank involves financial data analysis, while PyPoll focuses on election result analysis.

# PyBank: Coding Summary
Analyzes financial records from budget_data.csv. Calculates total months, net total of "Profit/Losses", average change, and records greatest increase/decrease in profits.

# PyPoll: Coding Summary
Processes election data from election_data.csv. Counts total votes, lists candidates, calculates each candidate's vote percentage and total votes, and identifies the winner.

# Structure

- Each challenge has its own folder (PyBank and PyPoll).
- Inside each folder:
  - A .py file: Main script for analysis.
  - A CSV file: Contains the dataset to be analysed.
  - A txt file: Stores analysis results.

# Execution

Run the .py in each folder for respective analysis. Results are printed to the terminal and exported to a text file in the analysis folder.
